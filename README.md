# Health-And-Fitness-App

This application displays the physical exercises to the user along with timer.
The start screen has BMI and History button. The BMI button lets the user to calculate his/her BMI. The history button displays the time stamps at which the user visits the application to perform the exercises. The concept of databse through sqlite is used here.
I have used the concept of timer and progress bar to display the rest time and exercise time of 10 secs and 30 secs.
The feature of recycler view is also used to display the number of exercises.
It also had the concept of how to hide the layout in an activity and display another layout in the same activity through visibility tag in XML code.
